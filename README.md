# What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an [advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) (a calendar that spans Dec 1st - 25th of every year) that presents a series of puzzles that can be solved using code.  It can be solved in any language and the puzzles themslves range from beginner-friendly to maybe-need-some-knowledge-about-data-structures.  Its [about page](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) describes it well so I highly recommend it.
  
# How should I use this repo?
Silly you, however you want!  Bang your head against the puzzles on your own first, ask stack overflow, ask [reddit AOC](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), check out my solutions here in this repo, and idk, maybe check out my [blog series](https://www.medium.com/@where_is_x) on AOC 2019?
