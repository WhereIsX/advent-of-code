# What is going on here?
This is a small collection of AOC puzzles I've worked on and how I've solved them.  2018 && 2019 are solved in ruby.  2020 are in crystal.  I tried to start a blog series a few times, but you're more likely to catch me livecoding (livechaosmonkeying) these on [my twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/where_is_x)
